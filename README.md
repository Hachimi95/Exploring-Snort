# Exploring-Snort

This lab immerses participants in Snort, on a local network. Using two interconnected machines, an attacker and a victim, within the same LAN segment, 
participants explore Snort's capabilities. 
The lab covers SYN flood attack detection, ping analysis, and Telnet testing..., showcasing Snort's effectiveness as an internal Network Intrusion 
Detection System (NIDS) for identifying and analyzing network-based threats within localized environments.
